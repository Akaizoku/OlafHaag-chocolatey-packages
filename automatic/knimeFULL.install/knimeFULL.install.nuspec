Please have a look at the [KNIME Analytics Platform product sheet](http://www.knime.org/files/Marketing/Datasheets/KNIME_Analytics_Platform_PDS.pdf) for details.

The KNIME Analytics Platform incorporates hundreds of processing nodes for data I/O, preprocessing and cleansing, modeling, analysis and data mining as well as various interactive views, such as scatter plots, parallel coordinates and others. It integrates all of the analysis modules of the well known [Weka](http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/) data mining environment and additional plugins allow R-scripts to be run, offering access to a vast library of statistical routines.

KNIME is based on the [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/) platform and, through its modular API, easily extensible. When desired, custom nodes and types can be implemented in KNIME within hours thus extending KNIME to comprehend and provide first-tier support for highly domain-specific data. This modularity and extensibility enables KNIME to be employed in commercial production environments as well as teaching and research prototyping settings.

KNIME is released under a dual licensing scheme. The open source license (GPL) allows KNIME to be downloaded, distributed, and used freely. See [license arrangements](http://www.knime.org/downloads/full-license) for complete details.
