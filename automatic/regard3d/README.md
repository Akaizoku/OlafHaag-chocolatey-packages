Regard3D is a structure-from-motion program (see also this [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_from_motion)). That means, it can create 3D models from objects using a series of photographs taken of this object from different viewpoints.
## Features:
* Based on powerful third-party tools and libraries
* Completely free and open sourced

# #Requirements:
* Regard3D is a 64-bit-only program. It only runs on 64 bit versions of Windows
* Windows 7 or newer (does not run on Windows XP, Vista not tested)
* OpenGL capable graphics card/chip
* Larger projects (many high resolution pictures) require a fast computer with lots of RAM (4 GB minimum, recommended 8 GB or more)
