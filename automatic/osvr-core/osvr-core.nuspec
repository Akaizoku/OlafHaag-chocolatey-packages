    <summary>OSVR-Core binary snapshots include the OSVR Server, an application that you start on your machine before running an OSVR-based app. It is responsible for communicating with the VR devices on your computer and presenting a generic interface to applications. OSVR-Core snapshots also include some plugins by default for hardware support, as well as sample configuration files.</summary>
    <description>
OSVR™ is an open-source software platform for VR/AR applications.

OSVR provides an easy and standardized way to discover, configure and operate hundreds of devices: VR goggles, position trackers, depth cameras, game controllers and more. OSVR supports multiple operating systems, plugs into leading game engines and is freely available under a permissive Apache 2.0 license.

OSVR standardizes the interface between input devices, applications and output devices so that application developers do not need to develop support for particular hardware. With OSVR, you can change the hardware even after the code is written. As hardware becomes better, the user experience improves as well.

OSVR is modular so tht one could mix-and-match components to create the best combination of hardware and software. Giving developers and users the freedom to choose what is best for them is a wonderful thing, much better than a ‘one size fits all’ approach.

OSVR can be extended with open- or closed-source plugins. Plugins can provide support for new devices or add analysis capabilities such as a gesture engine, sensor fusion and data logging and eye tracking.
