# chocolatey-packages
These are packages I'm setting up for software that wasn't already on the official feed, but that I thought useful (because I use them). For more information, see [chocolatey.org](http://chocolatey.org).

I'm new to his, so bare with me.

#### Package Parameters
The following package parameter can be set:

 * `-ia /D=` - this is for the installation path. (e.g. `cinst autodesk-123d-design -ia '/D=E:\SomeDirectory\somebody\123D-Design'`)
